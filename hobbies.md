Volleyball- I have played volleyball since I was in 4th grade and still play a couple nights a week. It is a fun activity to hang out with friends, have a couple beers, and get a little exercise.
Hiking- Getting out even for a shorter hike is a great activity to enjoy with my pup and refresh my mind.
Backpacking- Every summer I try to do a 3-4 day packing trip with my Dad. It is a great opportunity to spend some time with him and also completely unplug.
