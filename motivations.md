I have been working for the same company for the last 8 years. During my time there I have been able to grow my career a great deal and have built a good reputation there. The last few years I have felt like I have been going through the motions and not as engaged as I would like to be in a career.
My biggest motivation to make a change to a career that I wouldn't be just going through the motions. Turing is going to provide me with the skill set that will put me on a career path that I don't believe I will just be going through the motions. Programming is always going to be changing and I will always have opportunities to learn more!
