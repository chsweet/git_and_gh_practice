I have been fortunate to be able to travel a fair amount in my life. There are a couple trips that stand out for me though.

When I was in 6th grade we took a family spring break trip to Belize. Back in 2000 Placencia was not the tourist destination it is today. There were very few tourists and had a lot of unique experiences because of it. We went deep sea fishing for an entire day and I caught a shark!

Another trip that stands out was the last big one prior to the world shutting down. In late 2019 we took another family trip to Ireland. It was one of my sisters'(adopted friends) first time out of the country. We spent the week exploring and drinking pints. The weather was extremely Â nice the whole time we were there too!
